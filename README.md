![app-screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edands/randomQuoteGen/master/resources/style/Screenshot_2021-01-20%20Random%20Philosophy%20Quote.png)

Made just as a practice proyect using HTML, CSS, Javascript and a bit of jQuery.

I got the background from [SVGBackgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/).

Using [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to retrieve random quotes.

Feel free to suggest stuff, i am willing to learn. 

I will work on this on the future to futher improve it.
