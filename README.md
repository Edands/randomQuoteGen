# randomQuoteGen deployed at https://edands.github.io/randomQuoteGen/

Yet another random quote generator 

Made just as a practice proyect using HTML, CSS, Javascript and a bit of jQuery.

I got the background from [SVGBackgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/).

Using [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to retrieve random quotes.

Feel free to suggest stuff, i am willing to learn. 
I will work on this on the future to futher improve it.
