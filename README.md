A simple Random quote generator, just a little practice proyect to get me back at html, css and vanilla javascript. Feel free to suggest stuff, i am willing to listen and learn. I will work on this on the future to futher improve it.

I got the background from [SVGBackgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/).

Using [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to retrieve random quotes.
